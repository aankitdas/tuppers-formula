# 🧮 Tupper’s Formula Visualization

> A visual exploration of **Tupper’s Self-Referential Formula** — a mathematical curiosity that can literally plot its own image.

## 📖 About

This project brings **Tupper’s formula** to life through an interactive web visualization.  
The formula is famous because when graphed properly, it reproduces its own bitmap — a self-referential mathematical marvel.

## ⚙️ What to Expect

- A clean web visualization of **Tupper’s Formula**, rendered using LaTeX and Markdown.  
- Short explanation of **how the formula encodes an image** in binary form.  
- Future updates will include:
  - Step-by-step explanation of the formula’s logic.
  - Adjustable parameters and visualization scaling.
  - Interactive sliders to explore custom bitmaps.

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

Built with:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for coding
- **Markdown + LaTeX** for formula rendering  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
